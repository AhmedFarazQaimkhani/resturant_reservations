- UI
- Linter Rules

## Features that can be added

- React Query to cache data

## Challanges faced and Decision Taken

- Having issues of date in Reservations Json showing dates of 2018 updated those dates to 2022.
- Upcoming reservations I think should be any of present/after current time not for tomorrow only. 
- If its a requirement we just need to update a code on Reservation.tsx at line 46.
